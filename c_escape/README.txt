This is a demo for the function c_escape(), which accepts
a string and adds an escape ('\') in front of every '\',
'<' or '>'.

It is tested with several strings and can handle repeated
characters needing escape (e.g. "\<>" would become "\\\<\>").

My original attempt was wrong, to put it lightly. I wanted to
correct that.
